# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added the `feed` tool for ContextStream Context Feeds (list, ensure, get,
  update, archive, items, post, follow, unfollow, read, share, unshare,
  feedback, curate, runs, sources, ground) with a `feeds` bundle, typed
  client methods, and `[FEED]` lines plus structured `feed_items` in
  `session(action="ground")`. Feeds require a ContextStream deployment with
  `CONTEXTSTREAM_FEEDS_API_ENABLED`; the tool reports when the API is absent.

## 1.0.0

- Replaced the legacy TypeScript implementation with the canonical Rust MCP
  server while preserving public repository history.
- Added the MongoDB-free remote acceleration build.
- Added a dependency-free npm compatibility launcher with exact-version
  downloads, SHA-256 verification, atomic caching, offline reuse, and the
  `mcp-server`, `contextstream-mcp`, and `contextstream-hook` aliases.
- Added dual Streamable HTTP and npm stdio MCP Registry metadata.
- Minimized VCS capture to opaque checkout IDs, credential-free remotes,
  bounded/redacted subjects, and aggregate metadata; author identity and raw
  paths are not transmitted.
- Moved build, security, attestation, and release authority to this repository.
